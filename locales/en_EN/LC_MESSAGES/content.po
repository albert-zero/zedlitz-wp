msgstr "
In my painting, I find the freedom to express myself and go beyond societal norms and constraints. 
Each brushstroke unites contrasts like vitality and stillness, spontaneity and planning, strength and sensitivity. 
The creative process is a constant balancing act between intuition and learned techniques. 
It is within this space between planning and chance that my paintings come to life. 
My works aim to be not only visually appealing but also to evoke an emotion in the viewer.<br>
My latest works are more atmospheric and focus on mood rather than specific forms. 
This development reflects my need to continually reinvent myself and avoid being confined to a particular style. 
Each painting is a heartfelt endeavor, built up in many layers of paint, chalk, and pours, interwoven with personal 
impressions and intuitive moments, inspired by nature. As an artist, I strive to constantly push my boundaries and follow 
the artistic path without knowing where it will lead."

I often use natural materials I find during my daily walks - foliage, grasses, branches- and which I find inspiring, either due to the format or the structure. Many of the materials are already in a status to fade or pass away, eaten away by insects, snapped off by the wind,  bleached of by frost.

#=== ABOUT ME ==============================================================

msgstr "About Me"

msgid  "about-intro"
msgstr "
<p>I am Bettina Zedlitz, born in 1967 in Berlin, and I live in an old mill in Wiesloch-Baiertal. As a contemporary painter, 
I am known for my colorful and multilayered acrylic works that focus on themes of nature. My art captures not only the obvious 
beauty of nature but also the hidden aesthetics of decayed leaves and broken stems, through which I express the emotions and 
contrasts of life.</p>
 
<p>I prefer working on large formats, building them up in many layers with both painterly and graphic elements, as well as pours. 
For strong elements, I use materials like bitumen and sand, while silk paper and plastic bags create light and translucent areas. 
Coffee adds an additional depth to my works, as it is often incorporated. My tools range from hardware store devices and kitchen 
utensils to natural finds; brushes and spatulas of all sizes, as well as crayons and pencils, are also used to incorporate transparent 
colors and graphic details.</p>
 
<p>Recurring motifs in my work include flowers, trees, and other nature themes. All my paintings are dynamic and feature visual 
elements such as small, incompletely outlined areas.</p>
 
<p>My art stems from an inner need to make visual statements that emotionally touch viewers and evoke positive feelings. 
It addresses the contrasts of life, such as becoming and passing, holding on and letting go, and also incorporates the important 
theme of sustainability. Nature is at the heart of my work.</p>"

msgstr "<p>Today I put together a few frames again and I'm already looking forward to the future pictures that will be created on them. The first frame is 180x180cm and is the largest picture I have started so far. The frame with its double cross braces and the sheer size already posed a challenge for me during assembly and stretching the already somewhat painted canvas on it, even more so. Now the covered frame is on the wall and I'm thinking about what will become of it.</p>
<p>The second frame is 150x100cm. For me, this is a convenient format that also fits on many walls. Here I already know what will become of it: I will paint from a song for the first time. The first colors and shapes are already assigned in the head, soon it will start!</p>
<p>The third frame is 180x60cm, so extremely long. It is the same size as the tell me a story image. Here I am still thinking about painting it in portrait format, because that would also be a new challenge.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on what's going to happen!</p>"
